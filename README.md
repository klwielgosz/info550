## INFO-550 Project Instructions

For this project, I will analyze data collected by a research team I work with in the Global Health and Environmental Health departments. The data is part of a study called the MUSE Project, which is aiming to develop and validate a collection of measures around women's WASH-related empowerment in urban contexts. As part of the validation efforts, the survey contains several measures of mental health, including the PHQ-4 which includes thresholds for identifying whether someone is at risk for clinical levels of anxiety and clinical levels of depression.

To analyze the data you will need to install some R packages. The required packages can be installed using R commands.
