## INFO-550 Project Instructions

For this project, I will analyze data collected by a research team I work with in the Global Health and Environmental Health departments. The data is part of a study called the MUSE Project, which is aiming to develop and validate a collection of measures around women's WASH-related empowerment in urban contexts. As part of the validation efforts, the survey contains several measures of mental health, including the PHQ-4 which includes thresholds for identifying whether someone is at risk for clinical levels of anxiety and clinical levels of depression.

Data analysis will be run using `R`. All analyses can be run through the terminal using the Make file.

## Execute the analysis
To execute the analysis, you can download all files from this repository, change the working directory to where the downloaded files are, and then execute the Make file using :
``` bash
make
```
This will create 2 .png files for the figures and an .html file of the final report called info550.html that contains the results.
