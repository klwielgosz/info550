Within the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) sector, the role of women and girls in household WASH provision is well-documented. However, there are limited data on how and to what extent WASH conditions, interventions, and policies impact women’s empowerment, limited data on the extent to which women’s empowerment impacts WASH conditions, and no existing WASH-specific measures to assess empowerment.

&nbsp;

The MUSE project, with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, aims to develop and validate measures of women’s sanitation-related empowerment, focusing specifically on urban contexts. As part of the validation efforts, the survey contains several measures of mental health, including the PHQ-4 which includes thresholds for identifying whether someone is at risk for clinical levels of anxiety and clinical levels of depression.

Data was collected in both India and Uganda. Overall, the full data set has `r X ` observations, with `r Y ` observations from India and `r Z ` observations from Uganda.

&nbsp;

The PHQ-4 full scale (potential score range: 0-12), depression subscale (potential score range: 0-6), and anxiety subscale (potential score range: 0-6) were scored and descriptive statistics were run with the full sample, and country-specific samples. A summary of descriptives statistics are found below.

Further, binary risk scores can be calculated from the anxiety and depression subscales. For each subscale, a score greater than or equal to 3 is considered indicative of the participant being at risk for clinically significant levels of anxiety or depression. Risk scores were determined for participants in each country, and can be seen below.

&nbsp;

In Uganda, 26.9% of participants were at risk for clinically significant depression, while in India, 50.9% of participants were at risk.

&nbsp;

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="60%", out.height="40%",fig.cap="",fig.show='hold',fig.align='left'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("fig1.png"))
``` 

&nbsp;

The proportion of participants at risk for anxiety was far more similar across countries, however, the proportion at risk remains higher in India than in Uganda. In Uganda, 32.9% of participants were at risk for clinically significant depression, while in India, 35.7% of participants were at risk.
